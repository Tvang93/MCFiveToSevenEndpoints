Night and day, people would ask the {animal1} to {verb1} for them, and the {animal1}, showered with such luxuries, would comply. However, after many years, the {animal1} got tired of having to {verb1}. Tired of the {favoriteFood}. Tired of all the {favoriteThing}. The {animal1} wanted to go {activityToDo}, but with so many people constantly showing up and offering {favoriteThing} and {favoriteFood}, the {animal1} would never have the time. So the {animal1} came up with a plan. They would {changeAppearance}. However, even after that the {animal1} was still recognized, so the {animal1} had to come up with an even more extreme method: changing its {bodyCovering} color. The {animal1} turned its {bodyCovering} {favColor}, finally allowing the {animal1} to go {activityToDo} or anything else they wanted to do.";
